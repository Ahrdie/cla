# Contributors License Agreements

This repository serves as the umbrella project to manage contributor license agreements for the retel.io project.
Learn how to contribute and to sign up as a contributor.

Note to Contributors
--------------------

In order for us to accept any patches from you, you will have to electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of the open source license of the project that you’re contributing to.
* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we don’t “taint” the projects we manage with contributions that turn out to be improper. This protects everyone who wants to use the projects, including you!

Once you sign the [Contributor License Agreement](cla.md) (the “CLA”), we will then be able to merge your contributions.

To get started with this process, visit the [Sign the CLA page](sign-cla.md).

Acknowledgements
